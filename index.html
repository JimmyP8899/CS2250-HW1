    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a Third year student studying at California State Polytechnic Pomona, with an interest in cybersecurity. I participate in a club called Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology (SWIFT) and am eager to keep improving my knowledge about cybersecurity and software development. Currently, I participate in both red teaming and blue teaming competitions such as the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC), Hivestorm, and the National Centers of Academic Excellence in CybersecurityCompetition (NCAE-C).</p>
